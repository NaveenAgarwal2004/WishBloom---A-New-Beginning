  introMessage: `Dear Emma,

On this day, we've gathered our favorite memories of you—moments we've pressed between the pages of our hearts like flowers in a beloved book. Each memory here is a petal in the garden of who you are: vibrant, kind, and unforgettable.

As you turn 25, we want you to know how deeply you've touched our lives. These aren't just memories; they're love letters written in laughter, tears, and the quiet beauty of everyday moments.

May this collection remind you of how cherished you are, today and always.`,

      description: "I remember the day we met like it was pressed in amber. You were reading a book on philosophy while your latte went cold, completely lost in thought. When I asked what you were reading, you looked up with those bright eyes and started explaining Kant's categorical imperative with such passion that I forgot my own order. That's when I knew—this person sees the world differently, and I want to see it through her eyes.",

Your determination to understand every concept, to not just memorize but truly grasp the meaning—that's what made those exhausting nights bearable. You made learning feel like an adventure.",

You didn't make a big deal of it, just said 'that's what friends do.' But I'll never forget it. Your kindness isn't loud or showy; it's the quiet, steady kind that changes lives.",

Your sense of wonder makes everything an adventure.",

You understand it, and you share that understanding so generously.",

The truth is, no letter could ever be long enough or eloquent enough to express what you mean to me.\n\nYou've been my anchor in storms, my compass when I was lost, and my cheerleader when I doubted myself. You've celebrated my wins like they were your own and held me through my losses with a grace that still takes my breath away.\n\nAs you step into this new year, I want you to know: you are exactly who you're meant to be. Not perfect—perfectly, beautifully human. And that's more than enough. That's everything.",
